# Metrorized Topological Data Analysis

`Metrorization` is an image-domain topological feature extraction
package that:
* helps comparing images without showing them, and
* identiy topological feature from images.

The two main functions are:

    metrorization.metroize(img, ngrid, threshold,        plot, axes)
    metrorization.toposign(img, ngrid, plength, hlength, plot, axes)

See the [demo](demo/demo.ipynb) for their usages.
